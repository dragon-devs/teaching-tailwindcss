                Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me.
                Maybe. Sure, were too old to change the world, but what
                about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now,
                in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of
                pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five
                Chinese Brothers?HE deserve better? Look. If you
                think this is about overdue fines and missing books, youd
                better think again. This is about that kids right to read
                a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns
                you on, Seinfeld; maybe  how yget your kicks. You
                and your good-time buddies.
